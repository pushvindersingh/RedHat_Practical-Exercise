# RedHat_Practical-Exercise
Coding Exercise from Red Hat 

For this practical exercise we want you to create your own persistent “TODO list” program. 
There are no limitations on this program, it can be as “Simple” or as complex as you like. 
Some examples include, a CLI tool, a web application, a mobile application, chatbot or any other solution that you’d like. 
Below are some ideas for features you can implement:

●	Creation, updating and deletion of tasks (CRUD)

●	Labelling tasks

●	Filtering tasks

●	Multiple TODO lists

Therefore, to implement it I'm using Python and it's different libraries to create a GUI with different operations.
Also, I'm keeping the approach to be simple and easy rather than complex so that it is understandable to all.
